Implementation Notes:
  - read-command.c
    - Initially we constructed our command tree iterating from left to right since
		  the spec was unclear on specifications on precedence. It was not until discussion
			week 3 when the slides on project 1b made precedence clear. Thus we
			had to reform our code by breaking up the tree originally created and
			reforming it while following precedence rules. This can be seen in the
			functions break_tree and form_tree.
