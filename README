Implementation Notes:
  - read-command.c
    - Initially we used an algorithm to create a tree however 
    - as it was unclear in the spec as to what the precedence of 
    - certain operators was, print command printed with extra indents.
    - We decided to break the tree we made as it was fully syntactically
    - correct, and form it using a better algorithm.
